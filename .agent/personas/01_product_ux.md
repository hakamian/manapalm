   - Checkout & Payment flow (Frictionless).
   - Post-purchase: Viewing the tree's life story, photos, and location in the user profile.
   - Points & Loyalty: A simple system that rewards "Meaningful Actions".
2. **Deliverables:**
   - Structured list of pages.
   - Section and field definitions for each page.
